   <feature>
      <name>Strong Tonal Centres</name>
      <description>Number of isolated peaks in the fifths pitch histogram that each individually account for at least 9% of all notes in the piece.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch</name>
      <description>Mean MIDI pitch value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch Class</name>
      <description>Mean pitch class value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. A value of 0 corresponds to a mean pitch class of C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer units from there (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the mean pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Pitch Class</name>
      <description>The pitch class that occurs most frequently compared to other pitch classes. A value of 0 corresponds to C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer untis (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the most common pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Interval Between Most Prevalent Pitches</name>
      <description>Absolute value of the difference (in semitones) between the pitches of the two most frequently occurring pitches.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Variability</name>
      <description>Standard deviation of the MIDI pitches of all pitched notes in the piece. Provides a measure of how close the pitches as a whole are to the mean pitch.</description>

      <parallel_dimensions>1</parallel_dimensions>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Major or Minor</name>
      <description>Whether the piece is major or minor, as indicated by the first encountered major/minor metadata tag in the piece. Set to 0 if the metadata indicates that the piece is major, or set to 1 if the metadata indicates that it is minor. Defaults to 0 if the key signature is unknown.</description>
